# ITIL4 - ITSM (IT Service Management)
In business innovation and differentiation, speed to market is a key success
factor. If an organization takes too long to implement a new business idea, it is likely to be done faster by someone else. Because of this, organizations have started demanding shorter time to market from their IT service providers.

For service providers that have always used modern technology, this has not
been a big challenge. They have adopted modern ways of scaling their
resources and established appropriate practices for project and product
management, testing, integration, deployment, release, delivery, and support
of IT services. These practices have been documented and have triggered the
development of new IT management movements and practices, such as
DevOps. However, for organizations bearing a legacy of old IT architectures
and IT management practices focused on control and cost efficiency, the new
business demand has introduced a greater challenge.

# Service Management Practices:

## CAPACITY and PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
```
The purpose of the capacity and performance management practice is to ensure that services achieve agreed and expected performance, satisfying current and future demand in a cost-effective way.
```

`Definition: `**Performance**`  - 
A measure of what is achieved or delivered by a system, person, team, practice, or service.
`
## CHANGE CONTROL
```
The purpose of the change control practice is to maximize the number of successful service and product changes by ensuring that risks have been properly assessed, authorizing changes to proceed, and managing the change schedule.
```
`Definition: `**Change**`  - 
The addition, modification, or removal of anything that could have a direct or
indirect effect on services.
`

## INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
```
The purpose of the incident management practice is to minimize the negative impact of incidents by restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible.
```
`Definition: `**Incident**` -
An unplanned interruption to a service or reduction in the quality of a service.`

## IT ASSET MANAGEMENT
```
The purpose of the IT asset management practice is to plan and manage the
full lifecycle of all IT assets, to help the organization:
1. maximize value
2. control costs
3. manage risks
4. support decision-making about purchase, re-use, retirement, and disposal of assets
5. meet regulatory and contractual requirements.
```
`Definition: `**IT asset**` - 
Any financially valuable component that can contribute to the delivery of an IT
product or service.`


## Types of asset management

` `**Asset management**` is a well-established practice that includes the acquisition, operation, care, and disposal of organizational assets, particularly critical infrastructure.`

` `**IT asset management (ITAM)**` is a sub-practice of asset management that is specifically aimed at managing the lifecycles and total costs of IT equipment and infrastructure.`

` `**Software asset management (SAM)**`  is an aspect of IT asset management that is specifically aimed at managing the acquisition, development, release deployment, maintenance, and eventual retirement of software assets. SAM procedures provide effective management, control, and protection of software assets.
`

## MONITORING and EVENT MANAGEMENT
```
The purpose of the monitoring and event management practice is to systematically observe services and service components, and record and report selected changes of state identified as events. This practice identifies and prioritizes infrastructure, services, business processes, and information security events, and establishes the appropriate response to those events including responding to conditions that could lead to potential faults or incidents.
```

`Definition: `**Event**` - 
Any change of state that has significance for the management of a service or other configuration item (CI). Events are typically recognized through notifications created by an IT service, CI, or monitoring tool.`


## SERVICE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
```
The purpose of the service configuration management practice is to ensure that accurate and reliable information about the configuration of services, and the CIs that support them, is available when and where it is needed. This includes information on how CIs are configured and the relationships between them.
```
`Definition: `**Configuration item**` - 
Any component that needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT service.`


## SERVICE DESK
```
The purpose of the service desk practice is to capture demand for incident resolution and service requests. It should also be the entry point and single point of contact for the service provider with all of its users.
```
